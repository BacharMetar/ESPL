# ESPL Labs: Tasks 1-5 (A-C, E)

Welcome to the ESPL Labs repository. This repository contains code and documentation for a series of labs designed to enhance your understanding of C programming, memory management, debugging, and Unix/Linux system calls.

## Lab 1: Program Memory and Pointers, Debugging, and Simulating Object-Oriented Programming

**Goals:**
- C primer
- Understanding storage addresses and pointers
- Simulating object-like behavior in C

**Tasks:**
1. Debug segmentation faults using gdb.
2. Explore memory addresses, pointers, and arrays.
3. Implement and test functions for handling chars (input, print, encryption, decryption).
4. Develop a menu-based system using function pointers.

## Lab A: Program Memory and Pointers, Debugging, and Simulating Object-Oriented Programming (Alternate)

**Goals:**
- Similar to Lab 1 with alternative tasks and approaches.

**Tasks:**
1. Debug segmentation faults using gdb.
2. Explore memory addresses, pointers, and arrays.
3. Implement and test alternative functions for handling chars.
4. Develop an alternative menu-based system using function pointers.

## Lab 2: Simple Command Interpreter

**Goals:**
- Implement a basic command-line interpreter (shell).
- Understand Unix/Linux `fork()` and `exec()` system calls.
- Introduction to signals, redirection, and pipes.

**Tasks:**
1. Implement a simple shell to parse and execute commands.
2. Manage process execution (background processes, signal handling).

## Lab B: Simple Command Interpreter (Alternate)

**Goals:**
- Similar to Lab 2 with additional features and complexity.

**Tasks:**
1. Implement an enhanced simple shell.
2. Add additional process management features.

## Lab 3: Advanced Structs and Functions

**Goals:**
- Deepen understanding of structs and function pointers in C.
- Simulate object-oriented behavior.

**Tasks:**
1. Implement more complex function pointers within structs.
2. Extend the menu system to handle additional functions and commands.

## Lab C: Advanced Structs and Functions (Alternate)

**Goals:**
- Similar to Lab 3 with a focus on more complex applications.

**Tasks:**
1. Implement advanced function pointers within structs.
2. Extend the menu system for more complex functions and commands.

## Lab 4: File I/O and Error Handling

**Goals:**
- Master file input/output operations in C.
- Implement robust error handling.

**Tasks:**
1. Read from and write to files.
2. Handle errors gracefully and ensure program stability.

## Lab E: Networking Basics (Alternate)

**Goals:**
- Similar to Lab 5 with additional networking concepts.

**Tasks:**
1. Set up an advanced server to handle multiple client requests.
2. Implement a client to communicate with the advanced server.


## Lab 5: Networking Basics

**Goals:**
- Introduction to networking in C.
- Implement basic client-server communication.

**Tasks:**
1. Set up a simple server to handle client requests.
2. Implement a client to communicate with the server.
